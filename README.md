# Scripts
A set of helper batch files for Windows

## EditPath
Edit Path is not yet created, so ignore it on the menu system. Instead you will have to manually edit your Windows Path to add each of the folders. (Don't forget the sub-folders)

## First Run
After you clone this repo and configure your path, run 'nircmdcheck.cmd' to make sure NirCmd is installed and follow the directions. Next, re-open your Command Prompt window (or reboot your computer) for remain scripts to work.

## Protocols
For more information about the Protocols folder, read posts from my personal blog that are tagged with 'web-protocols'. Here's a link: http://archigos.ictcsc.com/tag/web-protocols
